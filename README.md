<h1>Celebrity Image Generation using DCGAN</h1>
<p>This code implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch to generate images similar to those in the CelebA dataset. It defines two neural networks: a generator (Generator) that creates fake images from random noise vectors and a discriminator (Discriminator) that tries to distinguish between real images from the dataset and fake images from the generator. The generator and discriminator are trained in an adversarial manner: the discriminator learns to correctly identify real and fake images, while the generator learns to produce increasingly realistic images that can fool the discriminator. The training loop runs for 20 epochs, using binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizers for both networks. Progress is tracked with the tqdm library, and after training, the generator is used to produce and display a grid of generated images.</p>
